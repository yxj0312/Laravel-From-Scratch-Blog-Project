# Ep 61 Toy Chests and Contracts

This next episode is supplementary. It's slightly more advanced, and reviews service containers, providers, and contracts. Though I do my best to break it all down, please feel free to ask any questions you might have in the comments below. Otherwise, if you feel left behind by this episode, the truth is you can sneak by for a long time without fully understanding these concepts.

imaging services container is a toy chest, you can add things to and you can fetch things out.

```php
class NewsletterController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Handle the incoming request.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */

    public function __construct(protected ApiClient $client, protected string $foo)
    {
        
    }

    public function __invoke(Newsletter $newsletter)
    {
        request()->validate(['email' => 'required|email']);

        try {
            $newsletter->subscribe(request('email'));
        } catch (Exception $e) {
            throw ValidationException::withMessages([
                'email' => 'This email could not be added to our newsletter list.'
            ]);
        }

        return redirect('/')->with('success', 'You are now signed up for our newsletter!');
    }
}
```

```php
class Newsletter
{
    public function subscribe(string $email, string $list = null)
    {
        $list ??= config('services.mailchimp.lists.subscribers');

        return $this->client()->lists->addListMember($list, [
            'email_address' => $email,
            'status' => 'subscribed'
        ]);
    }

    protected function client()
    {
        // you can also inject the config in the constructor
        return (new ApiClient())->setConfig([
            'apiKey' => config('services.mailchimp.key'),
            'server' => 'us6'
        ]);
    }
}
```

In the case of this Newsletter dependency:

1. Laravel starts by checking that toy chest(service container): do we have Newsletter?
2. If there's no Newsletter in that container, maybe we can just magically make one for it
3. Laravel checks Newletter class, and  there's no constructor dependencyï¼Œ and then use new to init the Newsletter
4. what if the dependency does have a constructor? laravel do his best to resolve the dependency for u, if he could not, throw an exception

How do we put something into the services container

We use AppServiceProvider as example

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Contracts\Pagination\Paginator;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Register any application services.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function register()
    {
        // app()->get('foo') or resolve('foo') to get the value (to get foo from newsletter)
        app()->bind('foo', function() {
            return 'bar';
        })

    }

    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function boot()
    {
        // Paginator::useBootstrap()
        Model::unguard();
    }
}

```

container is to store in many cases a key value pairs.

let's define newsletter in it

```php
public function register()
{
    
    app()->bind(Newsletter::class, function() {
        return new Newsletter(
            new ApiClient(),
            'foobar'
        )
    })

}
```

now in the NewsletterController, laravel knows the newsletter and can resolve it.

```php
class NewsletterController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Handle the incoming request.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */
    public function __invoke(Newsletter $newsletter)
    {
        request()->validate(['email' => 'required|email']);

        try {
            $newsletter->subscribe(request('email'));
        } catch (Exception $e) {
            throw ValidationException::withMessages([
                'email' => 'This email could not be added to our newsletter list.'
            ]);
        }

        return redirect('/')->with('success', 'You are now signed up for our newsletter!');
    }
}
```
